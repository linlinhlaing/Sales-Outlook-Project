# Sales Outlook Project

The **Sales Outlook Project** involves analyzing sales data to derive insights and make informed 
business decisions. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, aggregation, 
visualization, and database management. Students will use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and 
Matplotlib to manipulate and analyze the data, perform SQL queries for data retrieval, and create 
database tables to store the results. 


## Database Structure

The project revolves around four primary tables: Sales, Products, Customers, and Regions, each of which is represented by CSV files: `sales.csv`, `products.csv`, `customers.csv`, and `regions.csv`.

## Project Levels

### Level 1: Data Loading and Basic Analysis
- Load the sales dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Display initial rows and examine the dataset's shape and basic statistics.

### Level 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Address missing values, encode categorical variables, remove duplicates, normalize sales data, and handle outliers.

### Level 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize sales distribution, identify outliers, explore relationships with other variables, and analyze sales trends over time.

### Level 4: Data Aggregation and Grouping
- Aggregate sales data by various categories such as product, time, region, customer segment, and sales representative.

### Level 5: Data Visualization with Matplotlib
- Create visualizations including bar charts, line plots, pie charts, and scatter plots to represent various aspects of sales data.

### Level 6: Advanced Data Manipulation with Numpy
- Utilize Numpy for advanced calculations, arithmetic operations, reshaping arrays, broadcasting, and matrix multiplication.

### Level 7: Advanced Pandas Queries
- Apply Pandas for filtering, boolean indexing, groupby, aggregation, and DataFrame merging.

### Level 8: Creating Database Tables
- Design and create database tables for storing sales, product, and customer information, establishing relationships with foreign key constraints, and populating tables with sample data.

### Level 9: SQL Queries for Data Retrieval
- Write SQL queries to retrieve specific sales information, perform join operations, subqueries, and complex queries.

### Level 10: Advanced Data Analysis Techniques with NumPy and Matplotlib
- Utilize historical sales data to create time series arrays and visualize original and smoothed time series using Matplotlib.
